# Euler-Project-Solutions
My code for Euler Project problems
My code is currently in C, C++, and/or JavaScript  
Some problems may have code in one language and not another  
This repository will not and does not include methods for problems past problem 100.


If you haven't already completed these problems I highly encourage you to do so before reading my code. This for all intensive purposes is a sort of personal portfolio showing off my coding knowledge as opposed to a repository of highly optimized methods (some code is actually longer than needed intentionally so I can practice other programming skills).  


This repository contains no solutions although you could compile and run my code if you wanted to find them.
