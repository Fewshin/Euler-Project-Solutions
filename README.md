# Euler-Project-Solutions
My solutions for Euler Project problems
My solutions are currently in C, C++, and/or JavaScript  
Some problems may have solutions in one language and not another  
This repository will not and does not include solutions for problems past problem 100  
If you haven't already completed these problems I highly encourage you to do so before reading my solutions. This for all intensive purposes is a sort of personal portfolio showing off my coding knowledge as opposed to a repository of highly optimized solutions (some solutions are actually longer than needed intentionally so I can practice other programming skills).
